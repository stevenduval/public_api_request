# Project Title

Public API Request

## Getting Started

Using fetch() a list of 12 random employees with a 'nat' of 'US' are selected and displayed on the page.

To see more information about the employees, click on them which will display a modal window containing said information.

Once in the modal window you can close the window by using the 'x' or toggle to the next or previous employee by using the buttons at the bottom.

You can paste in names and click the search icon or start typing and the search feature will list all applicable employees.
